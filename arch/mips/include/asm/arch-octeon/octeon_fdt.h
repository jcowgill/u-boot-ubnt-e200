/**
 * Trims nodes from the flat device tree.
 *
 * @param fdt - pointer to working FDT, usually in gd->fdt_blob
 * @param fdt_key - key to preserve.  All non-matching keys are removed
 * @param trim_name - name of property to look for.  If NULL use
 * 		      'cavium,qlm-trim'
 *
 * The key should look something like device #, type where device # is a
 * number from 0-9 and type is a string describing the type.  For QLM
 * operations this would typically contain the QLM number followed by
 * the type in the device tree, like "0,xaui", "0,sgmii", etc.  This function
 * will trim all items in the device tree which match the device number but
 * have a type which does not match.  For example, if a QLM has a xaui module
 * installed on QLM 0 and "0,xaui" is passed as a key, then all FDT nodes that
 * have "0,xaui" will be preserved but all others, i.e. "0,sgmii" will be
 * removed.
 *
 * Note that the trim_name must also match.  If trim_name is NULL then it
 * looks for the property "cavium,qlm-trim".
 *
 * Also, when the trim_name is "cavium,qlm-trim" or NULL that the interfaces
 * will also be renamed based on their register values.
 *
 * For example, if a PIP interface is named "interface@W" and has the property
 * reg = <0> then the interface will be renamed after this function to
 * interface@0.
 *
 * @return 0 for success.
