# U-Boot for Ubiquity E200
This repository contains the source for U-Boot for Ubiquity E200 boards (aka
EdgeRouter ER-8 and ERPro-8). It is based on the GPL tarball released by
Ubiquity with a few minor adjustments.

The original tarball name is:
 EdgeRouter ER-8/ERPro-8/EP-R8 Firmware v1.9.11
 GPL.ER-e200.v1.9.1.1.4977353.tar.bz2

The modifications are mostly to get it to build with a "standard" mips toolchain
and to enable a number of missing U-Boot commands.
